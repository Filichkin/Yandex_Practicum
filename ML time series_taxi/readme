The RMSE metric value on the test sample should be no more than 48.
Instructions for completing the project

Load the data and resample it one hour at a time.
Analyze the data.
Train different models with different hyperparameters. Make a test sample of 10% of the original data.
Check the data on a test sample and draw conclusions.
